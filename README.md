This is a copy of the code for my website. I figured it'd be better to up it somewhere instead of letting it rot on my hard drives.

The most notable thing here is the Music Quiz, a small website where you get a small sample of video game music and have to guess the game it's from.

A lot of this was written quite a while ago and evolved while I was still learning stuff. Especially the SQL code in /musicquiz is super out of date and should not be used as an example for anything -- the code in /vesperia is a bit more recent and reasonable.
