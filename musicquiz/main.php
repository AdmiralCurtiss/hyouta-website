Feel free to still use it, but be aware that its content is very much of the time (and my taste in video game music back then) and some site features may be broken these days.';

Additionally, when logged in, a session cookie is stored in your browser to let you stay logged in. No identifying data such as your IP address is stored. The songs are played off Youtube, so it is possible that Youtube may indirectly collect some data on you; this site has no control over this.';
